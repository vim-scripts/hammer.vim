Hammer is a Vim plugin written (mostly) in Ruby.  It can be used to transform your markup language
of choice to HTML, and open the transformed HTML in whatever your favorite browser is.

It supports a large number of markup languages out of box but it also supports   adding custom
renderers for markup languages it does not support.

It has support for multiple different layouts (with one styled like the GitHub   README layout). You
can use your favorite template language to draw up your own   layouts (ERB, HAML, Â…). Layouts are
passed the rendered HTML as a partial.

People familiar with Ruby web development should feel right at home with the layout & partial style
templates.
